                    <h6>Proper Exercise – Asana</h6>
                    <p>
                        Proper exercise acts as a method to make sure that all your muscles, joints,
                        ligaments
                        and
                        tendons are flexible and have enough blood circulation.

                    <p>
                        This helps the body in becoming connected to its solar plexus, which is the core
                        of the
                        body. This also helps to increase your clarity and vitality.

                        Relaxation helps to give the body a reprieve and prevents it from becoming
                        over-worked.

                    <h6>Proper Thinking and Meditation – Vedanta and Dhyana</h6>

                        This helps you to put your mind in the correct place. This helps to settle your
